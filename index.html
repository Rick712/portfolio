                <h4>Minor Web Development</h4>
                <p>Web Apps From Scratch was one of the courses of the minor I did. The goal of the course was to create a web app from scratch that uses an API. I made an online Pokédex that uses the data from PokéAPI. PokéAPI is a RESTful API that contains detailed information about every Pokémon.</p>

                <h4>Minor Web Development</h4>
                <p>Browser Technologies was the third course of the minor. Browser Technologies focuses on progressive enhancement, feature detection and browser support. For this course, I made a online grilled cheese sandwich (tosti) builder, where you can make your own shopping list for making a tosti. The web app works on almost all devices and browsers, and adds functionality based on how new your browser and device is.</p>

                <h4>Minor Web Development</h4>
                <p>Performance Matters was the fourth course of the minor. Performance Matters focuses primarily on loadtime. For this course, I took my WAFS project, and made a backend for the web app with Node.JS. I also did a ton of other things to make sure the loadtime is as small as possible.</p>

                <h4>Minor Web Development</h4>
                <p>Web Design was the last course of the minor. Web Design was all about design principles, and implementing these. A huge part of the course was testing and accessibility. I had to make sure my website was accessible for a blind person.</p>

                <h4>Minor Web Development</h4>
                <p>After finishing all the courses and project I had to do the final project of the minor: the Master Test. During this project, I worked together with 4 other students of the minor. The project was about making a new website for the minor Web Development.</p>
                <p>A huge part of the project was to make a ton of experiments regarding people with a disability. Our main focus was a (real) person with spasm, and future students of the minor. The end product is a website that is good-looking, but accessible as well.</p>
